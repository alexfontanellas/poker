There are 5 players in the game. 4 are controlled by the computer and 1 by the player.

For each hand (every time somebody wins), the cards will be shuffled and 2 cards will be dealt to
each player. Then, the players will be able to start betting and start the hand by the Texas & Holdem rules.

A random number of players will randomly be bluffers
